Repository of the German Zikula Community

The branch ``core-2.0`` contains the translation for the new translation system based on Symfony. This should work with Zikula 1.4.6 as well

not finished yet, still a lot to do :-)

Only some translations are still in english. But you may want to use it. Try it and improve if you want. Feedback is wellcome.
