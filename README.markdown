Repository of the German Zikula Community

The branch ``core-2.0`` contains the translation for the new translation system based on Symfony. This should work with Zikula 1.4.4 as well

not finished yet, still a lot to do :-)

Attention! Here are a lot of untranslated strings included. They will cause blank output! '' is empty but valid :-). So do not use until translation is complete!
